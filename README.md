# Game of War

It is a simple card game where the player competes against the computer to draw the highest card. In the event of a tie, the game enters a "War" phase, requiring another card to be drawn to determine the winner.

## How to Play

1. The game starts by making an API call to create a new deck of cards.
2. Click the "Draw" button to draw a card from the deck.
3. The computer will also draw a card.
4. The player with the higher card value wins the round.
5. If there is a tie, the game enters "War" mode, and another card is drawn to break the tie.
6. The game continues until the deck is exhausted or one player reaches a predetermined score.
